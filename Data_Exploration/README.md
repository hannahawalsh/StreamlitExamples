# Advanced Data Exploration Using Streamlit

**Demonstrating the power of Streamlit.** [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/hannahawalsh/streamlitexamples/main/Data_Exploration/Wine_Data_App.py)

Streamlit is great for visualizing data interactively. Not only can you display data, but you can filter it, sort it, change it and keep getting updated displays. That's what this app is about - we're going into some advanced data visualizations using a Streamlit app.

This documentation goes into extreme detail about how this app was built. It is meant as a learning and teaching tool. I encourage you to play around with it first! See below for how to run this app on your machine or click the "Open in Streamlit" button above to see it as a shared app.
